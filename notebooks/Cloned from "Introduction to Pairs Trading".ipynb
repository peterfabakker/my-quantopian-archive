    "Pairs trading is a classic example of a strategy based on mathematical analysis. The principle is as follows. Let's say you have a pair of securities X and Y that have some underlying economic link. An example might be two companies that manufacture the same product, or two companies in one supply chain. If we can model this economic link with a mathematical model, we can make trades on it. We'll start by constructing a toy example.\n",

    "Before we proceed, note that the content in this lecture depends heavily on the [Stationarity, Integration, and Cointegration lecture](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/integration-cointegration-and-stationarity) in order to properly understand the mathematical basis for the methodology that we employ here. It is recommended that you go through that lecture before this continuing."

Because a short sale makes money if the security sold loses value, and a long purchase will make money if a security gains value, one can long parts of the market and short others. That way if the entire market falls off a cliff, we'll still make money on the shorted securities and hopefully break even. In the case of two securities we'll call it a hedged position when we are long on one security and short on the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Trick: Where it all comes together\n",
    "Because the securities drift towards and apart from each other, there will be times when the distance is high and times when the distance is low. The trick of pairs trading comes from maintaining a hedged position across X and Y. If both securities go down, we neither make nor lose money, and likewise if both go up. We make money on the spread of the two reverting to the mean. In order to do this we'll watch for when X and Y are far apart, then short Y and long X. Similarly we'll watch for when they're close together, and long Y and short X.\n",

You have some extra knowledge about an economic link that leads you to believe that the pair is cointegrated, so you go out and test for the presence of cointegration. In this case you will incur no multiple comparisons bias. At the other end of the spectrum, you perform a search through hundreds of different securities for any viable pairs according to your test. In this case you will incur a very large amount of multiple comparisons bias. \n",

    "Multiple comparisons bias is the increased chance to incorrectly generate a significant p-value when many tests are run. If 100 tests are run on random data, we should expect to see 5 p-values below $0.05$ on expectation. Because we will perform $n(n-1)/2$ comparisons, we should expect to see many incorrectly significant p-values. For the sake of this example we will ignore this and continue. In practice a second verification step would be needed if looking for pairs this way. Another approach is to pick a small number of pairs you have reason to suspect might be cointegrated and test each individually. This will result in less exposure to multiple comparisons bias. You can read more about multiple comparisons bias [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem)."

    "Examining the price ratio of a trading pair is a traditional way to handle pairs trading. Part of why this works as a signal is based in our assumptions of how stock prices move, specifically because stock prices are typically assumed to be log-normally distributed. What this implies is that by taking a ratio of the prices, we are taking a linear combination of the returns associated with them (since prices are just the exponentiated returns).\n",

This is a very simple way to handle the relationship, however, and is likely not feasible for non-toy examples. There are other potential methods for estimating the spread listed at the bottom of this lecture. If you want to get more into the theory of why having cointegrated stocks matters for pairs trading, again, please see the Integration, Cointegration, and Stationarity Lecture from the [Quantopian Lecture Series](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures#Integration,-Cointegration,-and-Stationarity).\n",

    "So, back to our example. The absolute spread isn't very useful in statistical terms. It is more helpful to normalize our signal by treating it as a z-score. "

    "### WARNING\n",
    "In practice this is usually done to try to give some scale to the data, but this assumes some underlying distribution, usually a normal distribution. Under a normal distribution, we would know that approximately 84% of all spread values will be smaller. However, much financial data is not normally distributed, and one must be very careful not to assume normality, nor any specific distribution when generating statistics. It could be the case that the true distribution of spreads was very fat-tailed and prone to extreme values. This could mess up our model and result in large losses."

    "In general taking a statistic over your whole sample size can be bad. For example, if the market is moving up, and both securities with it, then your average price over the last 3 years may not be representative of today. For this reason traders often use statistics that rely on rolling windows of the most recent data."
