    "Welcome to Quantopian. In this tutorial, we introduce Quantopian, the problems it aims to solve, and the tools it provides to help you solve those problems. At the end of this lesson, you should have a high level understanding of what you can do with Quantopian.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of the tutorial is to get you started, not to make you an expert Quantopian user. If you already feel comfortable with the basics of Quantopian, there are other resources to help you learn more about Quantopian's tools:\n",

    "## What is Quantopian?\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantopian is a cloud-based software platform that allows you to research quantitative financial factors in developed and emerging equity markets around the world using Python. Quantopian makes it easy to iterate on ideas by supplying a fast, uniform API on top of all sorts of [financial data](https://www.quantopian.com/docs/data-reference/overview). Additionally, Quantopian provides tools to help you [upload your own financial datasets](https://www.quantopian.com/docs/user-guide/tools/self-serve), analyze the efficacy of your factors, and share your findings with a global community of quants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, researching cross-sectional equity factors involves the following steps:\n",
    "1. Define a universe of assets.\n",
    "2. Define a factor over the universe.\n",
    "3. Test the factor.\n",
    "4. Share and discuss results with other quants with an eye toward improving your approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Quantopian, steps 1 and 2 are achieved using [**the Pipeline API**](https://www.quantopian.com/docs/user-guide/tools/pipeline), step 3 is done using a tool called [**Alphalens**](https://www.quantopian.com/docs/user-guide/tools/alphalens), and step 4 is done in the [Quantopian community forum](https://www.quantopian.com/posts). The rest of this tutorial will give a brief walkthrough of an end-to-end factor research workflow on Quantopian.\n",

    "### Research Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in this tutorial can be run in Quantopian's **Research** environment (this notebook is currently running in Research). Research is a hosted [Jupyter](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) notebook environment that allows you to interactively run Python code. Research comes with a mix of proprietary and open-source Python libraries pre-installed.

    "Press **Shift+Enter** to run each cell of code (grey boxes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1 - Define a universe of assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to researching a cross-sectional equity factor is to select a “universe” of equities over which our factor will be defined. In this context, a universe represents the set of equities we want to consider when performing computations later. On Quantopian, defining a universe is done using the [**the Pipeline API**](https://www.quantopian.com/docs/user-guide/tools/pipeline). Later on, we will use the same API to compute factors over the equities in this universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pipeline API provides a uniform interface to several [built-in datasets](https://www.quantopian.com/docs/data-reference/overview), as well as any [custom datasets](https://www.quantopian.com/custom-datasets) that we upload to our account. Pipeline makes it easy to define computations or expressions using built-in and custom data. For example, the following code snippet imports two built-in datasets, [FactSet Fundamentals](https://www.quantopian.com/docs/data-reference/factset_fundamentals) and [FactSet Equity Metadata](https://www.quantopian.com/docs/data-reference/equity_metadata), and uses them to define an equity universe."

To learn more about uploading a custom dataset, see the [Self-Serve Data documentation](https://www.quantopian.com/docs/user-guide/tools/self-serve). For now, we will stick with the universe definition above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2 - Define a factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining a universe, the next step is to define a factor for testing. On Quantopian, a factor is a computation that produces numerical values at a regular frequency for all assets in a universe. Similar to step 1, we will use the [**the Pipeline API**](https://www.quantopian.com/docs/user-guide/tools/pipeline) to define factors. In addition to providing a fast, uniform API on top of pre-integrated and custom datasets, Pipeline also provides a set of built-in [classes](https://www.quantopian.com/docs/api-reference/pipeline-api-reference#built-in-factors) and [methods](https://www.quantopian.com/docs/api-reference/pipeline-api-reference#methods-that-create-factors) that can be used to quickly define factors. For example, the following code snippet defines a momentum factor using fast and slow moving average computations."
